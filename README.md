# MatLab Image Analyses
This set of MatLab/Octave files is a small framework to analyze large sets of images. 

## Usage
It was develop to analyze a large set of brewery logos. The images should be placed in the "pics" directory and named like this:
"CITY_NUMBER_STATE_YEAR.png" (e.g. "aachen_001_nrw_1972.png" - or "aachen_001_nrw_1972b.png" if there are two of the same year)

## MatLab / Octave
Tested with:

* Octave 3.8.2
* MatLab R2011b
